# Sierra-Wireless-BC127-controller

Update: 12/16/2017

#############################################################################################

I am idiot, accidentally swapped this repo with another one I worked on and the originl repo
for 127 was gone, since I am lazy, I am just gonna HTTP wise upload the files here and update
the commit comments. This should be the final edition.

Update: 12/05/2017

#############################################################################################

      The original repo got pulled as requested. Product details has been updated.
      I can't find the page which I originally published, and I pulled it off last year.

#############################################################################################

After contacting them, I updated the name from BlueCreation to the new owner Sierra 
Wireless due to the fact the product line will be renamed as well. Also, I decide
to finish the final version. Since the future for this chip is unable to see.

To be honest, this move has disappointed a lot of hobbiers who are interested in the 
BlueCreation products.

Sierra Wireless is similar to Broadcomm, which has poor reputation on opensource support.

If you are interested in similar product, please try to find other alternatives.

Also, I will add the previous release note here as well later.

=================================================================================

Update: 12/04/2017

Now they are Sierra Wireless. Will consider to work on instructions with 
walkthroughs.

=================================================================================

Update: 11/23/2017

BlueCreation stops to dispatch orders and will migrate support.

Future is undecided.

Again, I have to yell out that you need to check your hardware model.

This code ONLY supports normal 127, not any EXT, APTX, HD variant or 118.

=================================================================================

Update: 07/31/2017

Add more comments to void confusing terms over the update.

=================================================================================

Update: 07/28/2017

Version being pushed out have some type issues, please update to latest version.

Also, we added Jonathan Falco's BC127 dual mode. Welcome to talk to him through
arduino forum.

=================================================================================

Update: 07/27/2017

Tried to create this new github page, due to the fact that original account is 
pulled and lost. Resolved by closing it and reopen new one.

Test site is working or not then restore all files.

=================================================================================

Update: 04/16/2017

AGAIN, people have been emailing me about why it does not work with their stuff.

This is for BC127 ONLY, will not work with any other chips, or any other variant!

If you need help, please contact BlueCreation.

=================================================================================

Update: 10/08/2016

makes the old version really irrelevant.

Update: 05/17/2016
