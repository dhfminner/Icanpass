# Sierra-Wireless-BC127-controller

Update: 12/13/2017

#############################################################################################

      The original repo got pulled as requested. Product details has been updated.
      I can't find the page which I originally published, and I pulled it off last year.

After contacting them, I updated the name from BlueCreation to the new owner Sierra 
Wireless due to the fact the product line will be renamed as well. Also, I decide
to finish the final version. Since the future for this chip is unable to see.

To be honest, this move has disappointed a lot of hobbiers who are interested in the 
BlueCreation products.

Sierra Wireless is similar to Broadcomm, which has poor reputation on opensource support.

If you are interested in similar product, please try to find other alternatives.

Also, I will add the previous release note here as well later.

Now they are Sierra Wireless. Will consider to work on instructions with walkthroughs.

Update: 04/16/2017

AGAIN, people have been emailing me about why it does not work with their stuff.

This is for BC127 ONLY, will not work with any other chips, or any other variant!

If you need help, please contact BlueCreation.

Added calling control. Also, I cancelled the Instructable page since the update 
makes the old version really irrelevant.
