I have been updating the project recently, however, I decide to stop for a couple of things.

First, BlueCreation has been integrated into Sierra Wireless. So I would not expect any Open Source support 
from this company. Second, I'd like to move on to other chips or micro computers since Raspiberry Pi is 
becoming more popular. I'd like to invest some time on that.

So far, the fifth version will be the last one i'd like to push out. However, I won't provide any support from 
then. Hope you do understand that if it breaks your system.

This will not work out of the box. Please modify and design on your own.

Cheers!
